# Neuromorphic Computing Research Summary

## Overview
Neuromorphic computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional von Neumann architecture towards brain-inspired computing systems that mimic the structure and function of biological neural networks.

## Core Principles

### 1. Biological Inspiration
- **Neural Architecture**: Brains consist of neurons connected by synapses, forming complex networks
- **Parallel Processing**: Unlike sequential von Neumann machines, brains process information in parallel across distributed networks
- **Energy Efficiency**: Biological neural systems achieve remarkable computational power with minimal energy consumption (~20W for human brain)

### 2. Key Characteristics
- **Event-driven computation**: Processing occurs only when spikes/events happen
- **Co-location of memory and computation**: No separation between processing units and memory
- **Massive parallelism**: Thousands to billions of neurons operating simultaneously
- **Adaptability**: Networks can learn, adapt, and reconfigure based on experience

## Biological Neural Networks

### Neuron Structure
```
Input → Dendrites → Soma → Axon → Synaptic Terminals → Output Spikes
```

### Key Components:
- **Dendrites**: Receive incoming signals from other neurons
- **Soma**: Integrates incoming signals and generates action potentials
- **Axon**: Transmits electrical impulses away from the soma
- **Synapses**: Junctions between neurons where signal transmission occurs

### Action Potential (Spike) Generation
1. **Resting Potential**: Neuron maintains -70mV membrane potential
2. **Depolarization**: Incoming signals increase membrane potential
3. **Threshold**: At ~ -55mV, voltage-gated Na+ channels open
4. **Spike**: Rapid depolarization to +40mV, followed by repolarization
5. **Refractory Period**: Brief period where neuron cannot fire again

## Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)

### Definition
STDP is a learning rule that modifies synaptic strength based on the precise timing relationship between pre- and post-synaptic spikes.

### Learning Rule
```
Δw = {
  +A * e^(-Δt/τ+)  if Δt > 0  (pre before post - LTP)
  -A * e^(|Δt|/τ-) if Δt < 0  (post before pre - LTD)
}
```

Where:
- Δw: Change in synaptic weight
- Δt: Time difference between pre- and post-synaptic spikes (t_post - t_pre)
- A: Learning rate amplitude
- τ+: Time constant for potentiation (~20ms)
- τ-: Time constant for depression (~20ms)

### Key Properties:
- **Asymmetry**: LTP window is broader than LTD window
- **Timing Sensitivity**: Millisecond-precision timing matters
- **Locality**: Learning depends only on local spike timing
- **Competitive Learning**: Leads to competition between synapses

## Neuromorphic Hardware Approaches

### 1. Digital Neuromorphic Systems
- **IBM TrueNorth**: 1 million neurons, 256 million synapses
- **Intel Loihi**: 128k neurons, 128M synapses per chip
- **SpiNNaker**: ARM-based neuromorphic platform

### 2. Analog/Mixed-Signal Approaches
- **Memristor-based systems**: Physical synapse emulation
- **Subthreshold CMOS**: Ultra-low power analog computation

### 3. Software Simulation
- **NEST**: Large-scale neural simulation framework
- **Brian2**: Python-based neural simulator
- **NEURON**: Single-cell and small network simulation

## Implications for Ψ Programming Language

### Spike-Flow Paradigm
- Programs as living neural networks rather than static instructions
- Computation through spike propagation and timing
- Self-modifying, adaptive program behavior

### Living Network Characteristics
- **Evolution**: Networks can grow, prune, and reorganize
- **Learning**: Programs learn from input patterns and experience
- **Adaptation**: Behavior changes based on environmental interaction
- **Emergence**: Complex behaviors from simple local rules
