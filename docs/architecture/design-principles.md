# ΨLang Design Principles and Constraints

## Overview
This document establishes the fundamental design principles, constraints, and architectural decisions that will guide the development of ΨLang. These principles ensure the language remains true to its neuromorphic, esoteric, and cognitive computing goals while maintaining feasibility and usability.

## Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Biological Authenticity
**Principle**: ΨLang should accurately model biological neural systems while maintaining computational utility.

**Constraints**:
- Neuron models must be biologically plausible (leaky integrate-and-fire baseline)
- Synaptic plasticity must implement STDP or similar biological learning rules
- Network dynamics should reflect real neural population behaviors

**Non-Goals**:
- Simplified neuron models that lose biological relevance
- Learning rules that don't reflect neural plasticity
- Network architectures that couldn't exist in biological systems

### 2. Esoteric Programming Tradition
**Principle**: Embrace the esoteric programming language tradition of innovative, boundary-pushing design.

**Design Patterns**:
- **Obfuscation**: Programs should be inherently difficult to understand
- **Minimalism**: Maximum expressiveness from minimal primitives
- **Innovation**: Pioneer computational models not possible in traditional languages
- **Aesthetic**: Beautiful in concept, challenging in practice

**Constraints**:
- Must achieve Turing completeness through spike-flow paradigm
- Core language should have ≤10 primitive operations
- Programs must be representable as neural network diagrams

### 3. Living Systems Paradigm
**Principle**: Programs are living systems that learn, adapt, and evolve.

**Core Properties**:
- **Self-Modification**: Programs can change their own structure
- **Learning**: Programs adapt based on experience and feedback
- **Evolution**: Networks grow and prune based on computational needs
- **Emergence**: Complex behaviors from simple local rules

**Constraints**:
- All programs must support learning from the start
- Network topology must be modifiable during execution
- Learning must be based on spike-timing relationships

## Technical Design Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
**Principle**: Computation occurs through discrete spike events, not continuous execution.

**Design Implications**:
- **Event Queue**: All computation scheduled as future events
- **Time-Based Execution**: Precise timing of spike events matters
- **Asynchronous Processing**: No global clock or synchronization barriers
- **Sparse Computation**: Only active neurons consume computational resources

**Constraints**:
- Maximum spike timing precision: 0.1ms
- Event queue must handle ≥1M events per second
- Memory usage should scale with active neurons, not total network size

### 2. Temporal Computation
**Principle**: Computation emerges from the precise timing relationships between spikes.

**Temporal Features**:
- **Spike Timing Windows**: Critical periods for synaptic integration
- **Rhythm Patterns**: Oscillatory behaviors for computation
- **Temporal Sequences**: Ordered spike patterns for information encoding
- **Causal Relationships**: Pre-synaptic spikes influence post-synaptic timing

**Constraints**:
- Minimum resolvable time difference: 0.1ms
- Maximum synaptic delay: 100ms
- STDP timing windows: ±50ms from spike pairing

### 3. Neuro-Symbolic Integration
**Principle**: Seamlessly integrate neural computation with symbolic processing.

**Integration Strategies**:
- **Symbol Grounding**: Symbols represented as neural activation patterns
- **Neural Rules**: Symbolic rules implemented as neural circuits
- **Hybrid Processing**: Neural learning of symbolic relationships
- **Emergent Symbols**: Automatic symbol discovery from neural activity

**Constraints**:
- Must support both neural and symbolic data types
- Symbol binding must be neurally implementable
- Symbolic operations must map to spike-timing patterns
